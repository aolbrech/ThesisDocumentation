Since the considered range is rather limited for the moment and the number of studied points is not much less than the number of degrees of freedom necessary to fit a decent polynomial of order 4, it should be ensured that a clear benefit is gained from applying this double-fit procedure.
Since for the second fit in this double-fit procedure 3 out of 9 points are rejected, only 6 points remain to fit a $\fth$ order polynomial which requires 5 points hence leaving only 1 single degree of freedom. This could possibly lead to problems, mainly because it is rather likely that good points are rejected and it is very difficult to check this from the individual $\loglik$ distributions.
\\

Therefore it should be checked whether the first fit could not be sufficient to obtain a smooth overall $\loglik$ distribution and whether the badly behaving events cannot be removed using the $\chisq$ or FitDeviation rejection as before.
As a first step the distributions without any influence of the $\pT$ cut will be considered, as given in Figure~\ref{fig::FirstVsSecondFitPos05} to \ref{fig::FirstVsSecondFitNeg05}. Here the sum of the first fit on the full range is given on the left while the second fit on the reduced number of events is given on the right.
