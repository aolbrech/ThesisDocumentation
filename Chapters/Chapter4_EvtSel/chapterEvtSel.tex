\chapter{Recovering signal event topology} \label{chp:labelTitle}

The previous chapter described in detail how the individual physics objects can be identified and reconstructed, however, in practice the enormeous amount of proton-proton collisions produced at the LHC and collected by the CMS experiment significantly complicates this matter.
As a result the biggest challenge of any physics analyis is to obtain, besides a succesful object identification, an efficient separation of the event topology of interest from the large bulk of background events.
This can be achieved by developing an effective event selection procedure that excludes events based on specific kinematic requirements, as will be demonstrated clearly in this chapter.
\\
\\
Such an event selection starts off with some basic identification and cleaning conditions and proceeds by fine-tuning the kinematic constraints in order to perfectly match with the analysis-specific requirements. Hence the selected event signatures are sequentially \textbf{narrowed down} until the desired event topology is almost completely retrieved. This chapter will first focus on the general kinematic requirements needed to be fullfilled in order to select semi-leptonically decaying top-quark pair topologies, Section~\ref{sec::MainSelec}, and then discuss in Section~\ref{sec::SpecificSelec} the various additional selection conditions introduced in order to optimise the event reconstruction efficiency in this analysis specifically.

\section{Selecting (clean) $\ttbar$+$\mu$ event topologies}\label{sec::MainSelec}
An important aspect of any physics analysis is to select only the event topologies compatible with the considered decay process and avoid detector noise mimicking the signal signature. 
Therefore a dedicated selection and cleaning procedure is applied by combining the online trigger system with an offline event selection in order to reduce the stored event rate while specifying which type of final state particles should be kept for further analysis.

\subsection{Triggering and cleaning of events}\label{subsec::Trigger}
As was already briefly mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chp:CERN}, CMS possesses a complex trigger system that decides whether the considered event is deemed interesting enough to be stored and processed further.
This trigger system uses an exhaustive list of distinct trigger paths, all designed to single out a specific type of final state signature and thus drastically reduce the event rate.
\\

In this analysis the event topology of interest is that of semi-leptonically ($l$ = $\mu$) decaying top-quark pairs, which can be distinguished rather efficiently from background by demanding a muon to be present in each event. This muon signature is rather distinct and will reduce a large portion of the background which is dominated by low-energetic jet processes.
Therefore the trigger path applied in this thesis only keeps events with at least one \textbf{isolated} muon for which the kinematic requirements fullfill $\pT$ $>$ 24 $\GeV$ and $\vert \eta \vert$ $<$ 2.4.
\\
\textit{Is the cleaning part of the triggering? Or is this a separate thing which has to be applied by hand?}

\subsection{Lepton selection criteria}
Since the applied trigger path is not specifically developed for identifying top-quark pairs decaying semi-leptonically, additional selection criteria are required for the leptons in order to further exclude incorrect event signatures. As a result the kinematic requirements are tightened a bit by requiring: $\pT$ $>$ 26 $\GeV$ and $\vert \eta \vert$ $<$ 2.1.
However, the more important lepton selection criteria necessary to apply are responsible for ensuring that the stored muon is a well-defined one.
\\
These so-called muon identification criteria start from Particle-Flow muons, which have been discussed in Section~\ref{subsec::PF}, and are designed to suppress hadronic punch-throughs, cosmic muons and muons from decays in flight of other particles.
They require the candidate muon to be reconstructed as a global one, and the global-muon track fit, with normalised $\chi^{2}$ $<$ 10, to contain at least one muon chamber hit.
Moreover the muon track should have a minimum of two muon stations with matched segments, contain at least one pixel hit and have more than five tracker layers which have been hit. The latter requirement will guarantee, besides suppressing muons from decays in flight, a good $\pT$ measurement for the muon.
Finally muon candidates not originating from the primary vertex are rejected by limiting both the longitudinal and transverse impact parameter: $\vert d_0 \vert$ $<$ 0.2 and $\vert \Delta z \vert$ $<$ 0.5.

Another important identification criterion is the isolation variable which allows to distinghuish prompt muons with high purity from the ones embedded in jets since it determines the hadronic (what about photon) activity around the muon candidate at the interaction vertex. %in a cone of radius $\Delta R$ = 0.4 around the muon candidate. 
It is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse energy of all the reconstructed particles contained within a cone of radius $\Delta R$ = 0.4, excluding the contribution of the muon itself.
However the large number of additional proton-proton interactions significantly complicates the identification of the interaction vertex requiring a correction variable to be applied in order to ensure a correct treatment of these supplementary interactions. 
For this reason a $\Delta \beta$-corrected isolation variable has been developed, which includes for the charged hadrons (CH) only the partons associated with the primary vertex while for the neutral ones (NH and $\gamma$) the estimated PU contribution is substracted. This contribution can be calculated by halving the PU contribution for charged particles since jets contain on average twice more charged PF particles than neutral ones~\cite{CHContrVsN}. The formula to determine this $\Delta \beta$-corrected isolation variable is given in Equation (\ref{eq::DeltaBetaIso}) and in this analysis $I_{\textrm{rel}}^{\Delta \beta}$ is required to be smaller than 0.12 in order to guarantee the reconstructed muon is well isolated.
\begin{equation}\label{eq::DeltaBetaIso}
 I_{\textrm{rel}}^{\Delta \beta} = \frac{1}{\pT^{\mu}} \left( \sum_{\textrm{CH}} \pT^{\textrm{CH}} + \max(0, \sum_{\textrm{NH}} \pT^{NH} + \sum_{\gamma} \pT^{\gamma} - 0.5 \sum_{PU} \pT^{PU}) \right)
\end{equation}
\textit{Is it pT or ET?}\\
\textit{Need plots?}\\
\textit{Muon veto discussed?}

\subsection{Jet selection criteria}
With the lepton selection clearly established, the next step consists of applying a similar type of identification and cleaning criteria to the selected events.
\\
\\

An notable difference in contrast to the leptons discussed before is that the PF jets require a few calibrations in order to correct for the small discrepancies observed between data and simulation (see \ref{subsec::jetReco}). These corrections need to be applied prior to the event selection for all jets \textbf{accounted for} in the event with $\pT$ $>$ 10 $\GeV$: charged hadron subtraction (CHS) which removes all the contributions of charged pileup, energy calibration using the L1L2L3 corrections and energy smearing in simulated events.
\\

Since the chosen trigger path does not restrict in any way the jets present in the considered event implies that the entire selection and cleaning process is taken care of by the offline jet identification criteria (\textit{Not even a minimum requirement on the pt?})
The actual event selection applied in this analysis requires an event to contain at least four high energetic jets ($\pT$ $>$ 30 $\GeV$) located within $\vert \eta \vert$ $<$ 2.4, which all have to be well separated from the identified lepton ($\Delta R$ $>$ 0.3).
The actual jet identification criteria have as goal to reject fake, badly reconstructed and noisy jets while still remaining with a pure sample of real jets and restrict the energy fractions of the different jet constituents. These criteria constrain the energy fraction of the charged electromagnetic PF particles ($f_{CEM}$ $<$ 0.99), the energy fraction of the charged PF hadrons ($f_{CH}$ $>$ 0), the energy fraction of the neutral electromagnetic PF particles ($f_{NEM}$ $<$ 0.99) and the energy fraction of the neutral PF hadrons ($f_{NH}$ $<$ 0.99).
\\

\textit{What about number of constituents and muon fraction ?? (+ what is this fHPD (0.98) and n90Hits in event selection file?)}

\section{Fine-tuning of the event selection}\label{sec::SpecificSelec}

The event selection constraints discussed in the previous section are kept as general as possible in order to be applicable for numerous analyses examining a similar event topology.
Since these selection criteria are centrally managed, their performance is continiously monitored and changing detector conditions are easily taken into account.
In addition, the various synchronization exercises between the different analyses using the same selection criteria significantly improves the selection efficiency. (\textbf{Be sure this is the case!})
\\

The above-mentioned selection criteria, however, still have to be fine-tuned in order to incorporate the analysis-specific requirements.
The analysis discussed in this thesis actually requires a very stringent event selection mainly motivated by the choice to use a Matrix Element method, see Chapter~\ref{ch::MW}, to measure the anomalous couplings in the Wtb interaction vertex. Such a method examines an event using the full kinematic information and thus necessitates a large processing time for each event. As a result it has been decided to restrict the considered event sample as much as possible in order to avoid wasting computational resources on incorrect event topologies.
\\
\\
Two important background-reduction constraints have been applied, each focussing on a different kinematic property and thus aiming to exclude distinct types of events. 
The first one, which is discussed in Section~\ref{subsec::BTag}, exploits the characteristic signature of semi-leptonically decaying top-quark pair events: the expected presence of two jets originating from the decay of a b-quark. The second requirement, Section~\ref{subsec::MassCuts} focuses more on the kinematic properties of the reconstructed jets by demanding their mass combinations to correspond with the top-quark and W-boson mass.
To finalize, Section~\ref{subsec::DataMC} will give an overview of the applied event selection and will demonstrate some of the kinematic properties of the remaining event sample.

\subsection{Background reduction using b-jet identification}\label{subsec::BTag}

Top-quark pair-production events for which one of the W-bosons decays hadronically and the other one leptonically are not merely characterised by the presence of a muon but also by the presence of two jets originating from the decay of the b-quarks.
Exploiting this latter property is an effective manner of distinguishing the event topology from the background, since the decay of the b-quarks has the peculiar feature that it gives rise to a displaced vertex. This is due to the relatively long lifetime of the b-quark such that the decay does not occur at the interaction vertex, as has previously been discussed in Section~\ref{subsec::jetReco}.
\\ 

For this analysis the b-jet identification is a crucial asset in reducing the background contribution since there has been opted for only selecting events for which at least two jets survive the b-tagging requirement. Since the main background samples for semi-leptonically decaying top-quark events might have events with one jet fullfilling this condition, the probability of having two such jets is significantly smaller (\textbf{Possible to give percentages?}). Hence the considered background samples; W-boson production in association with jets (W+jets), Z-boson production in association with jets (Z+jets) and single-top production in the t-, tW- and s-channel; will almost completely be excluded by applying this constraint.
%(\textit{Check if this is also in someway the case when only a double light is applied! .. Yes, main background of W+jets is only 10 $\%$ of ttbar sample! (Total is 20$\%$ of ttbar)})
\\

The b-jet identification algorithms developed by the CMS collaboration are recommended to only be deployed at specific working points defined as \textit{Loose}, \textit{Medium} and \textit{Tight} and this advice has been followed here.
These working points correspond to a predefined tagging probability of around 85$\%$, 69$\%$ and 52$\%$ and a misidentification one of 19$\%$, 5$\%$ and 1$\%$, respectively, for the Combined Secondary Vertex (CSV) b-tagging algorithm. (\textit{Good to repeat again ?})
\\
Since for this analysis priority is given to selecting event topologies matching with the expected topology as much as possible the double Tight b-tagging requirement is expected to result in the most desirable outcome, which can indeed be concluded from Table~\ref{table::bTagResults}.
This table summarizes the number of events for which all four jets are correctly picked out from the collection of reconstructed jets, denoted as signal s, and for which at least one has been wrongly chosen. These two categories, together with the events for which no information about the underlying parton is available, represents the background such that the $s/b$ value gives an idea of the jet reconstruction efficiency for the different b-tag working points.
\\
It has also been studied whether an improvement can be achieved by limiting the CSV discriminant of the light jets using an anti-tagging algorithm, but since the effect was close to negligible it will not be considered further.
\begin{table}[h!t]
 \centering
 \caption{}\label{table::bTagResults}
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} 
  \textbf{Option} 	& all 4 correct 	& $\geq$ 1 wrong 	& correct ($\%$) 	& $\frac{s}{b}$ 	& non-matched 	\\ \hline 
  2 L b-tags		& 426636 		& 612386 		& 41.0613 		& 0.696678 		& 1568843	\\ 
  2 M b-tags 		& 325578 		& 327020 		& 49.8895 		& 0.995591 		& 826872	\\

 \end{tabular} 
\end{table}

After these double b-tagging requirement the background samples have been significantly reduced and the only remaining contribution comes from the single-top quark events, and then in particular the tW-channel.
This can be explained 
\\
\textit{Now maybe give a Feynman diagram of single top to explain why it remains important.}\\
The application of this double Tight b-tagging algorithm is also the motivation why, besides the background samples discussed before, no other background contributions have been considered for this analysis as they will become completely redundant.
\\

%An important background reduction for semi-muonically decaying $\ttbar$ events can be achieved when the expected presence of two b-jets in the event topology is exploited. Since this is a rather %characteristic property of these type of events it will significantly decrease the contribution of events with the incorrect final state products.
%As has been explained in Section~\ref{subsec::jetReco} the algorithms responsible for the identification of the jets originating from b-quark decays exploit the fact that this decay does not take place at the interaction point due to the relatively long lifetime of the b-quark.
%For this analysis the b-jet identification is a beneficial asset since it will significantly reduce the risk of selecting non-$\ttbar$ events in the final event sample (\textit{, which would consume valuable resources}).

Since in this analysis emphasis lies on the correct reconstruction of the event topology, the choice of the b-tag working point has been based on the efficiency to precisely select the four jets present in the event. Hence, as was to be expected, the requirement of having at least two of these jets to be tagged using the most stringent working point results in the optimal reconstruction efficiency. As an additional bonus, this significantly reduces the event rates such that this additional event selection constraint also has a beneficial effect on the required processing time.
\\
With the b-tag working point fixed, the topology reconstruction proceeds by assigning the two most energetic jets surviving the b-tag requirement to the two jets originating from the b-quark decay. All other jets are then labelled as ``light jets'' and will need to be appointed \textbf{to the two} remaining jets in the event. 
In order to increase the efficiency of identifying the two correct light jets in the event the topology reconstruction has been adapted to consider the three most energetic light jets, if available, and assign the two most plausible ones to the jets produced during the hadronic decay of one of the W-bosons.
This choice again improves the topology reconstruction efficiency since for a significant number of events this third light jet is actually one of the correct jets.
\\
This light jet selection procedure is based on a $\chi^{2}$ method using both the mass of the lepton and the leptonic b and the mass of the hadronic b together with the two light quarks. Hence, this allows to, beside determining the two light jets, simultaneously distinguish the b-jet originating from the hadronic and the leptonic decaying top quark.
The expected values for both masses, denoted as $M_{lb}$ and $M_{qqb}$ respectively, have been determined using the semi-leptonically decaying top quarks with only the main event/the full event selection discussed up to now applied.\footnote{ (\textit{Why do you determine this before the b-tag? The b-tag will significantly influence the obtained mass values ... but will also reduce the available statistics ...} \textbf{Actually have also determined these values after the b-tags and the difference is almost negligible ...})}
The selection procedure then selects the event configuration for which these two mass values correspond the most with the expected values, taking into account their uncertainties.
\begin{equation}
 \chi^{2}_{M_{lb}, M_{qqb}} = \frac{(\hat{M_{lb}} - M_{lb})^{2}}{\sigma^{2}(\hat{M_{lb}})} + \frac{(\hat{M_{qqb}} - M_{qqb})^{2}}{\sigma^{2}(\hat{M_{qqb}})}
\end{equation}

An important motivation to use the $M_{lb}$ value in stead of the more obvious leptonic topquark mass is related to the difficult reconstruction of the neutrino.
Since only information on the $z$-component of this particle is available in particle detectors requires the determination of the $x$- and $y$-component the use of complex calculations based on the reconstructed masses. As a result it would not make much sense to reconstruct this particle, using the mass information, for then only using the leptonical top-quark mass. Especially since the $M_{lb}$ value can easily be reconstructed and fitted, although attention should be awarded to restrict the range where the fit is applied since this distribution is not expected to demonstrate the perfect Gaussian behaviour expected for the top quark mass.
