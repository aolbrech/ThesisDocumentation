\chapter{Pending issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Does this created FeynRules model still contain Effective Field Theory?
  \item If the kinematics doesn't change for coupling parameters larger than 1, how is then possible to differentiate the different configurations which will be studied?
  \item Access to Mathematica for Width studies ... ?
  \item XS values which are used are the ones calculated using the MadGraph$\_$v155 version. Should this be calculated again using the new MadGraphv5$\_$aMC@NLO since normally this shouldn't change ...?
  \item Create branch for localgrid scripts! (Now already a branch exists for the documentation !)
  \item Understand \textit{CorrectPhi} comment in MadWeight name \\ $\rightarrow$ Maybe related with phi issues of neutrino's ...
  \item EventWeight calculated in analyzer should be integrated into MadWeight output (Hence multiply MadWeight weight with the EventWeight for each event!) \\ \textbf{Otherwise all the effort to include the JES and PU stuff has no influence at all and is not taken into account!							}
  \item Update EventNumberInformation file to only cout the information when the event has passed the eventSelection requirements. Otherwise just discard this event from the output file in order to avoid a long .txt file and long running time ...
  \item When creating ntuples for Data/MC comparison the EventNumberInformation output should be stored here as well. This will allow to calculate the likelihood and weight distributions for specific $p_T$ cuts without having to run the entire base code again. So also the different python scripts which have been created should be moved to this .cc code in the future, so better not to spent too much time on improving these python scripts to avoid double work ...\\ For storing the generator decay channel information the c++ enum should be used which can store multiple variables (\textbf{Check this out!})
  \item Need to understand how MadWeight deals with the permutations ... Should this permutation of the light jets be done within MadWeight or should two .lhco files be created and sent separately to MadWeight. If the latter is the case, how should they be combined afterwards ?
  \item Be careful with used Beam Energy when using MadGraph. In the newest MadGraph directory this still seems to be set to 7TeV in stead of the required 4 GeV. \\ \textbf{Could this have an influence on the obtained MadWeight results when using the new MadWeight version (connected to the newest MadGraph version) ...}
  \item Specific MadWeight question for the latest version: \\ \textit{The 'refine' option allows you to realunch the computation of the weights which have a precision lower than X. \textbf{But how can you find this precision?}}
  \item Should a ScaleFactor correction be applied for the Branching ratio ? \\ \textit{This is not the case in code of James, but should find recommendations somewhere ...}
  \item \textbf{To Check:} Does MadWeight give a different weight when the Neutrino Mass changes?\\ $\rightarrow$ Currently mass is manually set to zero ...
  \item Running the analyzer code with the PileUp and JES/JER influences correct and active, the number of preselected events in the Event Selection Table has changed. Need to understand if it is expected that these corrections have an influence (lowering the number) on the number of preselected events ...
  \item Check whether the created root file can be trusted when the number of considered b-tags is greater than 1 ... !!

\chapter{Preliminary results}
%°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
The goal is to obtain as fast as possible results on generator level in order to ensure that no bottlenecks are found when running MadWeight.
The advantage of only using generator level results is that one can be completely sure that the studied events are properly semi-leptonic ttbar events. Hence MadWeight should not have any problems calculating the weight for these kind of events and no CPU time will be spent on uncorrect events.\\
This implies that any deviation from the expected results implies a bias, or even a problem, concerning the MadWeight output.\\
\\
Once the results correspond to the expectations these preliminary results should be easily extended to reconstructed events. Finalizing the event selection then allows to fully trust the results obtained on reconstructed level and make sure that any deviation should be explained by the influence of the applied event selection.\\
These results can then be used to optimize the event selection with respect to the MadWeight output and CPU time needed.

\section{Results on generator level}
\textit{Need to check the influence of the starting values now that the number of bins have been changed!}

\subsection{Transfer Functions}
In order to obtain results with MadWeight, the Transfer Functions which link the reconstructed energy distribution with the actual energy distributions should be calculated. In the case of generator level events this is not that important since no smearing of the energy is expected, but in order to avoid any bias from the used Transfer Functions it is adviced to use the real Transfer Functions with a slightly changed width.\\
\\
The method to obtain the parameters describing the energy smearing is (partly) explained in the PhD Thesis of Arnaud Pin\footnote{It should be noted that in the PhD Thesis of Arnaud, and in the current double Gaussian transfer function syntax in MadWeight, only 5 parameters are used. The narrow gaussian distribution doesn't have a normalisation parameter in front, but is normalized afterwards in the MadWeight code.} which can be found in:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & & https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/upload/theses/phd/Pin\_Arnaud.pdf \\
& & /home/annik/Documents/Vub/PhD/ThesisSubjects/AnomalousCouplings/\\ & & PrepareGenLevelRunning\_Sep2014/TransferFunctions
\end{eqnarray*}

\textit{For the moment (3 October 2014) I'm still waiting on feedback of Arnaud concerning the actual code he used to construct these Transfer Functions and the control checks and histograms he has built for ensuring the correctness of the built Transfer Functions.}\\
Up to now the method to obtain the parameters of the Transfer Functions is based on the code received from Petra and Lieselotte, which was used in the Master thesis of Lieselotte.
This code is actually based on the ROOT class FitSlicesY() but has some small differences. Some of these have already been changed in order to match with the ROOT class.\\
One of the most important differences between the two approaches was the treatment of the underflow and overflow bin. In the personal code these two bins were respectively added to the first and last bin and hence included in the fitting range. This is not the desired behavior since the size of underflow/overflow bin can be relatively large compared to the first/last bin and significantly change the value of these bins. This would then imply that the position of the first and last bin is not located at the correct position and will, especially in the case of a limited number of bins, have a significant influence on the fit result.
Now these underflow and overflow bins are just discarded from the fit range and will have no influence on the final result.\\
\\
Another important, but useful, difference between the two methods is the number of histograms which are saved. The personal code saves for each distribution which is considered the ProjectionY distribution together with the double Gaussian fit for this bin. This can not be changed in the ROOT class which only stores the distribution of the 6 parameters of the double Gaussian fit formula.\\
\\
However, even after carefully ensuring that both methods are identical the obtained results are not.
Up to now it is not clear what is the reason for the discrepancy between the two results and the only way to found out is comparing the distributions and results for a significant amount of statistics.\\
One possibility is the used fit ranges and number of bins. If the last bins are low on statistics their distribution might not agree with a double Gaussian distribution and hence result in a failed fit. Therefore the distribution for each ProjectionY bin is now closely studied for all of the considered histograms. This can be found is the following section \ref{subsubsec::FitRanges}.

\subsubsection{Comparing ProjectionY distributions}\label{subsubsec::FitRanges}
Each of the considered histograms is a 2D histogram where the x-axis represents the energy of the generator level parton and the y-axis the difference between the generator level parton and the reconstructed matched particle. This is done for the energy distribution and the $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles.

\paragraph{\underline{Remark:} Using transverse momentum in stead of energy\\}
The Transfer Function configuration files in MadWeight are flexible enough to change the kinematic variables used for the Transfer Function calculations. Hence it seems to be more relevant to utilize the transverse momentum in stead of the energy of the considered partons and jets. Especially since the LHCO file used in the MadWeight calculations has the transverse momentum as input variable. Therefore it seems much more useful and realistic to use this parameter and not the energy.\\
This implies that the Transfer Function configuration file should be adapted to use the \textit{pt(p)} and \textit{pt(pexp)} variables and not the currently used \textit{p(0)} and \textit{pexp(0)}.

\paragraph{Energy difference between parton and light jets\\}

The first bin in the left-hand histogram is asymetric because of the applied event selection cuts on the reconstructed level. These event selection cuts will not have the same influence on the generator level partons explaining the slight asymetric behavior.

  \caption{Energy dependency of the 6 parameters of the double Gaussian fit function. The two lowest rows show twice the same result, but with a different y-axis range. The double Gaussian fit parameters are combined in a histogram and then fitted with the Calorimeter energy function as explained in the PhD Thesis of Arnaud Pin.}
\end{figure}

From these fit results can be concluded that the double Gaussian distribution is well recovered for lower energy values. As can be seen from the very first histogram, the largest bulk of events have an energy value lower than 100 GeV. The low statistics in the higher energy range can partly explain the failing fitting performance. The double Gaussian function form is used in order to properly reconstruct the narrow peak together with the wider Gaussian distribution representing the tail of the energy distribution. However in the high parton energy range, this first narrow distribution dissapeared due to low statistics in this region. Hence fitting these distributions will indeed result in an unsuccesful fit status.\\
\\
A possible solution which can be considered is adding some of these histograms together and in this way enhancing the statistics in these combined bins. From the collection of distributions per bin could be concluded that the ``ok'' and ``failed'' fits are the ones with only about 2$\%$ of the total number of events. Hence it could be possible to adapt the code in such a way that in these cases the bin is combined with the following ones until a percentage higher than 3$\%$ is obtained.\\
Another solution consists of reducing the range of the fitted histograms and only fit the distributions with $E_{parton}$ $<$ 150GeV. However before continuing with this option it should be completely understood whether MadWeight is able to extrapolate in a correct way to higher energy values.

\subsection{Cross Section distribution for new grid}
%**************************************************

\subsection{First results: Wrong log(likelihood) minimum}

The first obtained MadWeight results for the enlarged grid ($V_L$ $\in$ $[0.8,1.2]$ and $V_R$ $\in$ $[-1,1]$) using only parton-level ttbar events did not result in the expected minimum of $(V_L,V_R)$ = $(1, 0)$. This can be seen from Figure \ref{fig::Likelihood}, which shows the distribution of the log(likelihood) for each point in the considered grid.\\ \\
\begin{figure}[!h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth]{/home/annik/Documents/Vub/PhD/ThesisSubjects/AnomalousCouplings/UnderstandLikelihoodDistr_July2014/AnomCouplings_GenEvent_NoSelect_Oct3200Events_SingleGaussUsed/Likelihood_NoXSNorm.png}
 \caption{Distribution of the log(likelihood) for each point in the grid using 3200 parton-level positive semi-muonic ttbar events. The transfer function used to smear the parton-level kinematics is the single-gaussian function standard included in MadWeight.}
 \label{fig::Likelihood}
\end{figure}
One of the possible influences on the displaced minimim of the log(likelihood) distribution could be the normalisation of the Cross Section influence. This XS normalisation ($\frac{XS}{XS^{SM}}$) should be multiplied with the likelihood value, not the log(likelihood). Hence in order to correctly take this into account the obtained log(likelihood) value for each point in the grid should be corrected using the logarithm of this XS normalisation. The distribution of the normalisation on the Cross Section can be found in Figure \ref{fig::XSandLikelihoodNorm} together with the log(likelihood) distribution after correctly taking into account this XS normalisation.\\ \\
\begin{figure}[!h]
 \includegraphics[width = 0.45 \textwidth]{/home/annik/Documents/Vub/PhD/ThesisSubjects/AnomalousCouplings/UnderstandLikelihoodDistr_July2014/AnomCouplings_GenEvent_NoSelect_Oct3200Events_SingleGaussUsed/XSNorm.png}

 \caption{Distribution of the XS normalisation for positive semi-muonic ttbar events (left) and distribution of the log(likelhood) after taking into account this normalisation. As in the previous figure 3200 positive semi-muonic have been used to obtain this distribution and a single gaussian transfer function has been applied to smear the kinematics of these parton-level events.}
 \label{fig::XSandLikelihoodNorm}
\end{figure}
The formula which has been used is the following (Equation \ref{eq::ProbMW}):
\begin{eqnarray}
 P(y \vert a) = \frac{1}{\textcolor{red}{\sigma(a)}*Acc(a)} \int W(y|x,a)*Eff(x,a) \vert M(x,a) \vert^{2} T(x,a) dx \label{eq::ProbMW}\\
 \mathcal{L} = \prod P(y \vert a)
\end{eqnarray}
The normalisation which has been applied in Figure \ref{fig::XSandLikelihoodNorm} is given in Equation \ref{eq::LikelihoodNorm}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq::LikelihoodNorm}
 \mathcal{L}_{Norm} = - ln(\sum P(y \vert a)*\frac{XS}{XS^{SM}}) = -ln(\mathcal{L}) - ln(\frac{XS}{XS^{SM}}*N)
\end{equation}
\textbf{It should be checked whether this is the correct method to take into account the normalisation of the XS. Currently it has been assumed that this XS normalisation should be applied for each weight and hence is multiplied with the number of considered events. In the case that this normalisation should just be multiplied with the overall likelihood value ($\mathcal{L}$) the sum over the number of considered events drops out of the equation implying a very small influence of the XS on the log(likelihood) distribution.}\\ \\

As highlighted in the general Matrix Element Method formula (Equation \ref{eq::ProbMW}), the probability to measure the observed quantities $y$ already has a normalisation factor for the cross section. This factor is defined as the channel cross section and is calculated using Equation \ref{eq::ChannelXSMW}:\\ \\
\begin{equation}\label{eq::ChannelXSMW}
 \sigma(a) = \int_{X_i} \vert M(x,a) \vert^{2} T(x,a) dx
\end{equation}
\textbf{Hence it should be investigated in detail whether this XS normalisation should still be applied. From the above equations could be concluded that the change in cross section is actually already incorporated in the weight obtained from MadWeight. This could make sense since MadWeight has all the necessary information to calculate the cross section for each point in the considered grid. The cross section values for each point have been calculated using MadGraph and the same model as used for the MadWeight calculations. Unfortunately it is not completely clear from the MadWeight documentation whether this is actually included in the weight or not.}

\subsection{Correct normalisation of Matrix Element probability}
As could be seen in Equation \ref{eq::ProbMW} a term $\sigma(a)$ is included in the general Matrix Element Techniques formula. However it is not clear whether this cross section normalisation is actually performed within the MadWeight calculations or whether this normalisation should be done afterwards.\\
This question is closely related to the order of the current obtained weight values with MadWeight. Up to now no weight larger than $10^{-22}$ have been obtained, resulting in a very large log(likelihood) value. \\
\\
This small value can be caused by many different reasons for which the most plausible ones are listed here:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The normalisation of the MadWeight probability should still be done and is not performed within the Matrix Element Techniques formula.\\ \textbf{This can only be ruled out by contacting the Madweight experts and asking explicitely what is done in the Madweight calculations. Also a possible hint could be found inside the MadWeight python files (but this should only be done if the received answer is not perfectly clear).}
 \item The smallness of the weight could be caused by an error inside the created FeynRules model. \textit{Should also look for the mail where one of the MadWeight experts (Olivier/Pierre or even Celine) answered about the possible explanation for the smallness of the weight and whether this implies some wrong assumptions).}\\ \textbf{A possible way to exclude that the origin of this problem is the AnomalousCouplings FeynRules model is by comparing the results for the top mass fit when both the SM FeynRules model and the AnomalousCouplings model is used. If the weights are also this small when the SM model is used this smallness should be solved by an additional normalisation factor.}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Update 31/10/2014: Probability function NOT normalized (according to mail Olivier)\\}
As was expected from the smallness of the obtained MadWeight probabilities should the cross section normalisation be applied afterwards. Only in the older versions of MadWeight (based on MG) was this normalisation included automatically.

\subsubsection{Measurement of top quark mass using Matrix Element Method}

\paragraph{Comparing SM model with AnomalousCouplings model\\}
As a first step the Feynmann diagrams belonging to the two different models should be compared. This information can be found in the \textit{index.html} file in the following directories (and the files should be opened using firefox on mtop since this is the only m-machine with a working browser):
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \tiny{/AnomalousCouplings/MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO/madgraph5/SM\_ttbarSemiMuPlus} \\
 \tiny{/AnomalousCouplings/MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO/madgraph5/ttbarSemiMuPlus\_QED2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Comparing SM cross section with MassiveLeptons cross section\\}
In order to be sure that both models have the same Standard Model base, the cross sections for both models have been compared. This resulted in an unexpected outcome, namely that the obtained cross sections differ significantly depending on which MadGraph version is used to generate the considered events. A summary can be found in Table \ref{table::MGXS}.
\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{Top quark mass}	&  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{MadGraph aMC@NLO}	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{MadGraph v155}  	\\
					&  SM model	& MassiveLeptons model		& SM model 	& MassiveLeptons model	\\
  \hline
    153 				& $9.23$ pb	& $9.645$ pb			& $6.692$ pb	& $6.984$ pb		\\
    163					& $11.12$ pb	& $11.63$ pb			& $7.844$ pb	& $8.199$ pb		\\
    173					& $12.98$ pb	& $13.54$ pb			& $8.897$ pb	& $9.281$ pb		\\
    183					& $14.77$ pb	& $15.4$ pb			& $9.884$ pb	& $10.3$ pb		\\
    193					& $16.5$ pb	& $17.22$ pb			& $10.78$ pb	& $11.25$ pb		\\
  \hline 
 \end{tabular} 
 \caption{Cross section values for semi-muonic (+) ttbar decay obtained using two different MadGraph versions.} \label{table::MGXS}
\end{table}

From this table can be seen that there is, for both considered MadGraph versions, a small difference between the SM FeynRules model and the MassiveLeptons one. This could be caused by the different treatment of the leptons. In the SM model they are considered to be massless while in the MassiveLeptons one they are defined to have their actual mass.\\
A larger differrence occurs when both MadGraph versions are compared. From the answer received by Olivier it is not clear whether this difference is worrysome or could be explained by the LO theoretical uncertainties. Should also be investigated whether this difference is related to the NLO behavior of the newest MadGraph version. In case the MadGraph v155 version is not up to NLO a difference in cross section is definitely expected.

\section{Comparing the two used MadWeight versions}
Since it was found that the latest MadWeight version (aMC@NLO) resulted in many events with weight equal to $0$ it was decided to compare this version with the previous one (mc$\_$perm). It is expected that both versions result in similar weights when identical events are considered, otherwise the used version of MadWeight would have a too large influence on the analysis result.\\
Therefore two events which could succesfully run in the newest MadWeight version were also calculated using the old version. The obtained weights and their uncertainty can be compared in the following table and all the relevant information can be found in:
\begin{eqnarray*}

 \caption{Weight obtained from MadWeight for two specific ttbar semi-muonic (+) events. For these events the $V_R$ was fixed to its Standard Model expectation value, which is $0$, while the $V_L$ value was varied.} 
\end{table}

Comparing these values clearly shows that there is a significant difference between the two MadWeight versions which were considered in this analysis. With some effort a general difference of a facto 10 can be identified between the two versions, with a higher weight value for the older mc$\_$perm MadWeight version.\\
However when showing the relative differences between the different weights it can be seen that the behavior of these two MadWeight versions is actually very similar. Therefore the histograms below give firstly the actual weight value and secondly the weight value normalised to the weight corresponding to the coupling parameter $V_L$ = 0.
\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Distribution of the weights obtained from MadWeight for the two considered MadWeight versions (aMC@NLO and mc$\_$perm) for two specific ttbar semi-muonic (+) events.}
\end{figure}

The above histograms clearly indicate that however the actual values of the weight significantly differ, the normalized results are almost identical.\\
\textbf{This implies that the results obtained with MadWeight should always be normalized with respect to another MadWeight result} (obtained using the same MadWeight version of course). 
%**************************************************

\section{Individual weight distribution for condsidered gridpoints}
The first Likelihood distribution for the considered gridpoints gave rise to an unexpected result. In order to understand whether this strange behavior can be explained by a couple of events with a bad weight, the indiviudual weight distribution for a couple random events was studied. If these distributions indeed result in the correct behavior the events which influence the overal Likelihood distribution can be studied individually.\\
All the relevant information can be found in the following directory:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 /home/annik/Documents/Vub/PhD/ThesisSubjects/AnomalousCouplings/ \\ UnderstandLikelihoodDistr\_July2014
\end{eqnarray*}
And the creation of the MadWeight weights together with the python scripts making the corresponding histograms can be found in:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 /localgrid/aolbrech/madweight/ttbarSemiMuPlus\_QED2/Events
\end{eqnarray*}
The relevant python scripts are the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{CalculateLikelihood.py} which simultaneously creates the histograms for the XS distribution, the raw and normalized Likelihood distribution, and if required the individual weight distributions for the selected events. All these histograms are saved in the Histos.root file.
 \item \textbf{RemoveZeroWeightEvents.py} which removes the events with weight equal to zero from the list and saves the non-zero events in a new .out file. On the other hand the events which failed the MadWeight computation are saved on a new .lhco file together with one succesful control event and are send again through MadWeight for a new weight calculation. \textcolor{red}{This should be updated since the new computation of MadWeight also results in weights equal to zero for these failing events. So should be investigated what is different about these events ...}
\end{itemize}

The first three histograms show the obtained Likelihood distribution for the different gridpoints which were considered. From these can be concluded that the behavior of the Likelihood normalized with the corresponding cross section divided by the Standard Model cross section is dominated by the distribution of the normalized cross section values. This means that any small deviations of the raw Likelihood values gets washed out by the multiplication with the normalized cross section values.

\section{Normalized coupling parameters}
In order to investigate the actual influence of the value of the coupling parameters on the kinematics of the event, the considered coupling parameters should be normalized to unitarity before any hard conclusions can be made.
Therefore the configurations which should be investigated in large detail are the ones for which the width of the decay remains unchanged. This is explained in detail in one of the previous sections (\ref{subsec:DecayWidth} on page \pageref{subsec:DecayWidth}).
%**************************************************

\section{Understanding parameters larger than 1}
Before starting to look at the ttbar Monte Carlo and reweighting the events with MadWeight, the created model in FeynRules should be completely understood.
Special care goes out to the behavior of the kinematic distributions for values of the coupling parameters larger than 1. Since the Standard Model expectation puts the real part of the left-handed vector coupling $V_L$ almost equal to 1, simulation should be available around this Standard Model expectation value.
Therefore the created model should be able to cope with coupling parameters larger than 1. \\
\\
For this reason .lhco files were generated with MadGraph with the following configuration, as mentioned in \ref{subsec:MadGraphFiles}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  Re(V_L) & \in & \left[  0.7, \; 1.3\right] \\
  Re(V_R) & \in & \left[ -0.3, \; 0.3\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
For these generated events the main kinematic distributions have been investigated.
No clear difference between the behavior below and above 1 has been found.

 \end{tabular} 
 \caption{Cross sections for the different RVR-RVL couplings normalized to the SemiElMinus Standard Model Cross section (8.261 pb)} 
\end{table}
From this table can be seen that the cross section increases when the real component of $V_L$ gets larger. The value of the right-handed vector coupling has only a minor influence on the cross section.

\subsubsection{Relative increase visible in XS, but not in kinematic distributions}
Since the observed model cannot represent physics at values larger than 1, one option is to look at specific fixed values of the real part of the left-handed and right-handed vector couplings. 
A proportional change in both of these coupling parameters should change the cross section values, but the kinematic should remain unchanged. Therefore the following configurations will be investigated:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  Re(V_L) = 0.5 ~~~ \& ~~~ Re(V_R) = 0.5 \rightarrow ~2.07115~ pb\\
  Re(V_L) = 1.0 ~~~ \& ~~~ Re(V_R) = 1.0 \rightarrow ~33.1479~ pb\\
  Re(V_L) = 2.0 ~~~ \& ~~~ Re(V_R) = 2.0 \rightarrow ~530.027~ pb
\end{eqnarray*}
From the above numbers is clear that the Cross section becomes very large when the two coupling parameters increase.
This can be understood quite easily since the second option allows much more decay options since the top quarks can decay both through the left-handed and the right-handed vector coupling side of the interaction vertex. The width of this configuration is not equal to the width of the Standard Model expectation and hence does not correspond to an actual physical solution. It is merely seen as a test of the model since the kinematics of the interaction should not differ.\\
\\
Looking at these plots clearly indicates that the kinematics doesn't change at all.\\
Hence the created FeynRules model is able to deal in a correct way with these coupling parameters larger than 1.\\

\section{Choice of b-tag requirements}

\subsection{Signal vs background comparison}
Since the complete event should be reconstructed as accurately as possible the 'signal' is represented by the case that all four particles are matched correctly while the 'background' events are the events for which at least one particle is matched wrongly.
Events which are not matched using the JetPartonMatching algorithm (currently ptOrderedMinDist with dR of 0.3 is used) are not included in either of these two variables and are shown separately in the tables found below.\\
First the different b-tag options are compared for the four possible combinations which are still allowed, namely the interchange of both the two light quarks and the two b-jets.

 \begin{table}[!h]

 \end{table} 
 
Above tables show a clear improvement for the 2 Tight b-tag case since suddenly the $\frac{s}{b}$ value goes up to almost 2. An additional benefit of the 2 Tight bt-tag case is that it as well will take care of a large part of the process backgrounds. Hence the motivation for selecting this b-tag option.\\
Comparing the normal 2 Tight b-tag case, where the light jets are defined as not being Tight b-tagged jets, against the two possibilities using a light-jet veto indicates no motivation to go for the light-veto option.\\
\\
However the second table, showing only the reconstruction efficiency of the b-jets, shows an improvement when using a light-jet veto.\\
This means that, even if the number of selected events gets lower, the percentage of correct events does improve when asking for a light-jet veto since it ensures that mistagged b-jet events doesn't by mistake get identified as light jets. So events with a b-jet with a too low CSV discriminant now don't get selected anymore because these so-called light-jets don't survive the veto cut.\\
\\
But, as confirmed by the last table, the efficiency of the light-jet reconstruction shows no distinct improvement. So for some reason the light-jets which are chosen with this veto method are not by definition the actual light-jets.

 \caption{Overview of the number of times the correct b-jet combination is chosen when using a $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method} 
 \end{table}
 
The two tables in this subsection require a different interpretation. The first one is actually a combined test of the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method and the optimal b-tag choice while the second one is merely a performance check of the mlb method. \\
This second table had to be added since the first table can't be directly compared against the tables in the previous subsection since currently only one b-jet combination is left while in the previous case an iteration between the different b-jets was allowed. So the numbers will be lower by definition when the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method is applied.\\
Therefore the second table is relevant in order to select whether some clear gain can be obtained when applying this method since it represents the number of times the correct b-jet combination. If this percentage is higher than 50$\%$, which is the case, an improvement is obtained compared to an iteration between the two possible combinations.\\
\\
The first table indicates again that no real difference is found between the different b-tag options, but that as soon as 2 Tight b-tags are applied the $\frac{s}{b}$ improves slightly. Also the second table shows no difference in efficiency between the different b-tag options, but shows however that the use of this $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method significantly enhances the correct choice of the b-jet combination. In about 84$\%$ of the cases the correct b-jet combination is chosen.

\section{Considering 2 or 3 light jets}
In order to try to improve the signal efficiency it can be considered to add a third light jet to the particles which have to be taken into account for the jet selection. Adding this third jet will however result in 4 additional combinations which have to be considered so this method will only benefit when the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method is applied. Since MadWeight uses so much CPU sending the $6$ possible combinations to MadWeight will not be beneficial.

 \end{table} 

These three tables look at either a pure 5 jet case or a pure 4 jet case and comparing the numbers in each table with eachother is probably not extremely relevant. This because in the pure 5 jets case the matching requirement is loosened to two out of the three chosen light jets correctly matching with the partons. So in $1$ out of $3$ possibilities the so-called correct event will not be correct resulting in too high numbers for this case.\\
\\
The first column gives the percentage how often the chosen jets are indeed the correct partons, hence in the 5-jet case the number of times the 5 possible jets match with the 4 correct partons. In the 4-jet case it implies that the four chosen jets are matched correctly with the 4 partons. The second column gives a similar value since the signal is defined as the number of times the matching was done correctly for the four partons while the background stands for the events where one of the matching is not succesful. The third column checks how often the third jet is one of the two correct light jets and compares it against the number in the first column. So it represents the number of times adding the third jet results in an improvement of the event reconstruction. \\
\\
The numbers which are relevant in these tables are exactly these two last columns. These numbers show that in about $70 \%$ of the cases the third jet is actually one of the correct quarks. Therefore it can be decided from these numbers that in quite a lot of events, an improvement can be obtained when this third light jet is considered as well.

 \end{tabular} 
 \caption{Overview of the number of times the correct b-jet combination is chosen when using a $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method} 
 \end{table} 
When the $m_{lb}$ method is applied, the two first columns in the given tables represent similar quantities with the only difference that now the 4 jets which are actually chosen by the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method are considered. 
In this case the third column represents the number of times the third jet is chosen when the two light jets are matched correctly, implying that the third jet is one of the correct ones and that the second light jet is also correctly matched. The final column only looks at the third jet and puts no requirement on the matching of the second light jet. So it compares the number of times one of the chosen jets is the third jet and in how many cases this chosen third jet is one of the correct partons.

\subsection{Compare efficiencies for 3$^{rd}$ jet with 1$^{st}$ and 2$^{nd}$}
The obtained efficiency numbers for the 3$^{rd}$ jet seemed to be rather high so to exclude any possible double-counting mistakes the percentages for the 1$^{st}$ and 2$^{nd}$ jet where also calculated and compared. Since the considered percentage represents the number of times the 3$^{rd}$ jet corresponds to one of the actual light quarks should the sum of the three percentages not become any larger than 200$\%$.\\
The percentages were calculated both before and after the application of the $\chi^{2}$ algorithm and the results can be found in Tables \ref{table::FirstSecondThirdJetPerc} and \ref{table::FirstSecondThirdJetPercMlb}. The first table shows the numbers before the application of the $\chi^{2}$ algorithm implying that for correctly matched events 2 of the 3 light jets are correctly matched. The second table gives the results after the $\chi^2$ minimization method.

\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                 & Number of events & Percentage ($\%$) \\
  \hline
  Matched events & 2455 & \\
  \hline
  First jet      & 1596 & 65   \\
  Second jet     & 1740 & 70.9 \\

  \hline
  Total          & 4910 & 200
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Number of times the first, second or third jet corresponds to one of the two correct light jets before the application of the $\chi^{2}$ method.}\label{table::FirstSecondThirdJetPerc}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                 & Number of events & Percentage ($\%$) \\
  \hline
  Matched events & 241 & \\
  \hline
  First jet      & 162 & 67.2   \\
  Second jet     & 178 & 73.8 \\
  Third jet      & 142 & 58.9 \\
  \hline
  Total          & 842 & 200
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Number of times the first, second or third jet corresponds to one of the two correct light jets after the application of the $\chi^{2}$ method.}\label{table::FirstSecondThirdJetPercMlb}
\end{table}

From these tables can be concluded that the obtained percentage of about $70\%$ for the 3$^{rd}$ jet is actually correct and that the result can be trusted. It also implies that in the 5-jet case (meaning that there actually is a third light jet) the three jets have a rather similar probability of being the correct jet.

\subsection{Considering separate categories}
In order to be certain whether the 3$^{rd}$ light jet should be considered the considered events have been divided into two categories. The first only consists of events with exactly 2 light jets, hence 2 or more b-tagged jets\footnote{The number of events with a third b-tagged jet is extremely small and will probably not really influence the efficiency as can be seen from the plots shown in \ref{subsec::MSPlotsNBTaggedJets}.} and 2 light jets, while the second category allows for more light jets. In case of multiple b-tagged jets only the two highest $p_T$ jets are considered.\\
In the second category each event is treated in two separate ways. First the event is seen as a pure 4-jet event implying that only the two leading light jets are kept while for the second approach the third light jet is also included in the $\chi^{2}$ algorithm resulting in 6 possible solutions.\\ \\
For these three cases the matching and $\chi^{2}$ minimization efficiency have been compared in order to ensure that the most efficient event selection will be used. The results can be found in Table \ref{table::LightJetCategories} and indicates that including the third light jet doesn't result in a large gain of efficiency. On the contrary, including events with more than 4 jets but discarding the third light jet results in a significant decrease of efficiency.

\begin{table}[!h]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                         & N(2 light jets) & N(2+ light jets)  \\
  \hline
  $\#$ events            & 9328            & 6436 \\
  $\#$ matched events    & 4018            & 3319 \\
  $\#$ good combi chosen & 3273            & 788 -- 1604
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Number of events, number of matched events and number of events for which the correct jet combination is chosen using the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb} - m_{qqb}$ algorithm for the two considered categories. The first number in the right-hand bottom corner respresents the number of good combinations chosen when the event is treated as a 4-jet event while the second number is for the treatment of a 5-jet event. An event is considered as matching if the 4 jets corresponding to the generator event are included in the collection of selected jets.}\label{table::LightJetCategories}
\end{table}

The obtained results seem rather suprising since it implies that only asking the 4 leading jets results in the worst efficiencies. \\
However it should be noted that for this configuration the 2 Tight b-tag constraint might influence this result. It could be possible that for looser b-tag requirements the mis-identification of the two b-jets results in a worse ``combination choice'' efficiency.\\

\begin{table}[!h]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
                         & Only 4-jet events & All, but treated as 4-jet & All, but treated as 5-jet  \\
  \hline
  $\%$ matched events    & 43.07                   & 46.5                               & 46.5  \\
  $\%$ good combi        & 81.4                    & 55.3                               & 66.5
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Percentages for matching the reconstructed event with the generated and for selecting the good combination using the $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb} - m_{qqb}$ algorithm. }\label{table::JetCategoryPercentages}
\end{table}

\textit{Is it possible to understand these results using the percentages for the first, second and third jet being correct .. ? \\ When treating a 5-jet event as a 4-jet event the correct jet would have been the third, discarded, jet in $\frac{1}{3}$ of the cases which explains the significant reduction. However the difference between treating the event as a 4-jet or a 5-jet event doesn't result in a large difference. It seems that in much of the N(2+ light jet) cases the correct jet is actually still one of the following jets and is not included in the three leading light jets.}

\section{Studying optimal cut on $\chi^{2}$ value}
The tables shown here indicate that the application of a cut on the $\chi^{2}$ value of the $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method doesn't change the rates of good and wrong chosen events. Therefore it will only reduce the number of selected events, and hence reduce the needed CPU time, but still keep an as pure sample as obtained without any cut.\\
Since there is no real difference visible between setting the cut value to $3$ or $5$ it is advisable to use the cut value of $3$ to reduce the number of selected events.

\section{Influence of using $p_T$ cuts suggested by the TOP reference selection Twiki}

The TOP Reference Selection Twiki, and the different subgroup Twikis, suggest to use different event selection requirements than used before. The values suggested can be found in the table below, together with the values which were used for producing the tables and figures given above.\\
In this section the different results will be compared for these two event selections in order to ensure that the influence of this event selection can be ignored. If this is not the case, all the above tables have to be replaced and updated (which will however happen on a larger time-scale since these will be the correct values which will be used further in this analysis). The main goal is to quickly check whether the conclusion obtained from the above figures and tables still remain valid.
\begin{table}[!h]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
                      & Old values & TOP RefSel values \\
   \hline
   selected jets      &   40 GeV   &       30 GeV      \\
   selected muons     &   25 GeV   &       26 GeV      \\
   selected electrons &   32 GeV   &       30 GeV      \\
   veto muons         &   10 GeV   &       10 GeV      \\
   veto electrons     &   10 GeV   &       20 GeV      
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the following table the number of selected events after the different event selection cuts which are applied in this analysis can be found. The left-handed columns contain the information when the old $p_T$ cuts are applied while the right-handed columns gives the number of selected events when the recommendations of the Top Reference Selection Twiki are followed.\\
\\
From the comparison of the two columns can be seen that lowering the $p_T$ cut on the selected jets significantly improves the percentage of selected events, especially because of the improved selection efficiency for the third and fourth jet. This can easily be understood from the $p_T$ distribution histogram for the different leading jets which can be found below.
These distributions show that in the case of the fourth jet, moving the $p_T$ cut from $30$ GeV to $40$ GeV cuts away the largest percentage of this fourth jet since its distribution is peaked at a lower $p_T$ value. The influence is much lower for the first and second jet because their distrubition is maximal around $100$ GeV so changing this $p_T$ cut only affects the left side of the tail of the distribution.\\

\subsection{Influence on choice of b-tag option and use of $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method}
With these new values considered for the event selection requirements, the obtained percentages and $\frac{s}{b}$ values should be compared again.
The values wich are obtained using these new $p_T$ cuts can be found in the following tables.\\
The first three tables show the results before the use of a $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method while the last two tables give the obtained numbers when this $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method is applied.\\
\\
Analyzing the numbers in this tables clearly indicates that the obtained results for the old $p_T$ cuts correspond to the values obtained earlier, which implies that the obtained values can easily be compared against each other and stil represent the same variables. The small differences which are however visible can be easily explained by statistical deviations.\\
Comparing the results obtained using the new $p_T$ cut values with the ones using the old cut values clearly indicates that the old values resulted in slightly better selection efficiency and $\frac{s}{b}$ value. Both for the selection efficiency of the b-quark jets and the light jets a higher percentage is found when using the old $p_T$ cut values. \\
A positive remark corresponding to the new $p_T$ cut values is that the behavior of the different considered b-tag options is similar. The 2 Tight b-tag case without any veto on the light jets results in the highest selection efficiency and $\frac{b}{s}$ value. Hence the choice of the used b-tag option does not need to be updated.\\
\\
Even the use of a $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method doesn't improve the selection efficiency and $\frac{s}{b}$ values when changing to the newer $p_T$ cut values. However compared to the previous case when no $\chi^{2}$ $m_{lb}$ - $m_{qqb}$ method is applied the difference between the two $p_T$ cut options becomes slightly less significant (from 18 $\%$ to 13 $\%$ difference). Still no improvement can be found impying that lowering the $p_T$ cut on the jets only increases the number of selected events but doesn't insures selection more good events, on the contrary the selection efficiencies decreases even.

\section{Which event corrections should be applied?}

\subsection{Trigger choice}
Two possible triggers exist, namely the so-called SingleLepton triggers or the CrossTriggers. The former kind only uses the information of the lepton while the latter one combines the lepton information together with the jets present in the event. These second kind of triggers were developed since it was expected that the $p_T$ cut which had to be applied on this SingleLepton trigger would become too high to be physically relevant. However it has been found that the applied $p_T$ cut doesn't differ that much between these two triggers, especially in the muon case the difference is almost negligible.\\
\\
Since the scale factors which should be applied are much more complex in the case of the CrossTriggers preference is given to these SingleLepton triggers.\\
Minor disadvantage of these kind of triggers is that no information can be found on the TOP Twiki page (\url{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/TopTrigger}) and currently no other Twiki page has been found with similar information ... Trigger contacts of TOP group prefer the use of the CrossTriggers since a lot of time and effort has been put into the development of these triggers. Probably the reason why no clear documentation is found on the Top Twiki page.\\
But James is using the same triggers in his analysis so all these triggers, and the different versions, can be found in the following two analyzer files:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \url{https://github.com/TopBrussels/FourTops/blob/master/FourTop_EventSelection.cc} which contains information about the muon event selection and used triggers.
 \item \url{https://github.com/TopBrussels/FourTops/blob/master/FourTop_EventSelection_El.cc} which contains the same information but about the electron case.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lumi- or PileUp Reweighting}
The choice of the root file which should be used for the LumiReweighting is related to the Monte Carlo samples which will be used. If the Summer 12 MC samples, which describe the 8 TeV data, are used the \textit{S10} file should be used.\\
LumiReweighting is actually taking into account the influence of PileUp but can't be called this way when publishing results since a systematic influence of PileUp is no physical variable. However the luminosity of MinimumBias events is. This systematic influence can be calculated by comparing the influence of the up and down part.

\subsection{Lepton Scale Factors}
Lepton scale factors should be used and can be found in the code of James.\\
In the muon case the scale factors correspond to the entire dataset (ABCD) since different scale factors have been obtained for the different runs. Therefore caution should be applied when only running over a limited range of data in order to avoid to run only over the A part. However the influence shouldn't be too large ...\\
\\
In the electron case the scale factors have been hard coded and do not vary for different parts of the data sample. \textbf{Therefore it should be checked whether the hard-coded numbers which are used in James code are still the correct ones which should be used. Hence a twiki with this information should be found ...}

\subsection{Jet Energy Correction factors}
Information available in the analyzer of James is up-to-date and can be copied.


\subsection{Jet corrections (on the fly ...)}
In James analyzer code Jet corrections are applied on the fly which is no problems, since even if the considered sample has these corrections already applied, the method of incorporating these jet corrections uses the gen information. So this avoids that these jet corrections would be applied twice ...

\section{Choice of Monte Carlo samples}
Same samples as James can be used, which are the latest Jan22 rereco samples. A full overview of these samples can be found on:
