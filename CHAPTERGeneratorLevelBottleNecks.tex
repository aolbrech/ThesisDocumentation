The idea behind studying generator-level results is to ensure that no bottlenecks are encountered when running MadWeight.
The advantage of only using these type of events is that one can be completely sure that they are actual semi-leptonic ttbar events. Hence MadWeight should not have any problems calculating the weight for these kind of events and no CPU time will be spent on uncorrect events.
This implies that any deviation from the expected results implies a bias, or even a problem, concerning the MadWeight output.\\

Once the results correspond to the expectations, these preliminary results could be easily extended to reconstructed events. Finalizing the event selection then allows to fully trust the results obtained on reconstructed level and make sure that any new deviation can be explained by the influence of the applied event selection.
These results can then be used to optimize the event selection with respect to the MadWeight output and CPU time needed.
%
%However the first results obtained with MadWeight in this created FeynRules model did not result in the desired solution. It was observed that the minimum of the obtained $-\ln(\mathcal{L})$ did not correspond the the expected Standard Model value of ($V_{L}, V_R)$) = ($1.0, 0.0$). This was then investigated further and a possible solution was found in the missing cross section normalisation. Hence a detailed calculation of the cross section value of each point in the grid was performed, and also here some discrepancies were found. 
%The most important one was the observation that the cross section values varied when moving from one MadGraph version to the other one. Hence also here a thourough investigation was performed.

\section{Uncorrect $\ln(\mathcal{L})$ minimization}
The first obtained results for the full grid ($V_L$ $\in$ $[0.8,1.2]$ and $V_R$ $\in$ $[-1,1]$) using only parton-level ttbar events did not result in the expected minimum of $(V_L,V_R)$ = $(1, 0)$. This can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig::Likelihood} which contains the distribution of the $\ln(\mathcal{L})$ for each point of the grid. Looking at these values in detail clearly shows that the minimum of this distribution can be found in both upper corners, and not in the expected center of the grid. It is even worse than at first sight, because the Standard Model value corresponds almost to the maximum of the distribution. The only two values which are still slightly higher are the ($0.9,0.0$) and ($0.8,0.0$) ones.\\
A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the missing normalisation of the cross section for each point in the grid. Figure~\ref{fig::XS} contains the relative cross section, $\frac{XS}{XS^{SM}}$, for each point in the grid and clearly shows that this distribution has the opposite behavior as the $-\ln(\mathcal{L})$. Hence normalising the MadWeight output with this relative cross section factor might result in a correct minimization.\\

 \label{fig::XS}
\end{figure}

Originally XS normalisation was applied in MadWeight, but has been removed in the MadGraph5 version. But correct implementation can easily be derived from the so-called general Matrix Element\footnote{Obtained from papers $arXiv:1101.2259$ and $inspirehep:854451$.} formula which is given in Equation (\ref{eq::ProbMW}). 
\begin{eqnarray}
 & & P(y \vert a) = \frac{1}{\textcolor{red}{\sigma(a)}*Acc(a)} \int W(y|x,a) \vert M(x,a) \vert^{2} dx \label{eq::ProbMW}\\
 & & \mathcal{L} = \prod P(y \vert a) \\
 & &  \sigma(a) = \int_{X_i} \vert M(x,a) \vert^{2} dx
\end{eqnarray}

The factor $\sigma(a)$ is defined as the channel cross section and is the XS normalisation factor which should be applied. So the previous use of $\frac{XS}{XS_{SM}}$ was incorrect, especially because the new cross section value was placed in the numerator in stead of in the denominator. The additional part with normalising with respect to the Standard Model cross section, $XS_{SM}$, is less important because it will only introduce a general up- or down-scaling of the overall normalisation factor since it is the same for each point in the grid.\\
Since the negative log of the likelihood is used as MadWeight output, special care should be awarded to the correct implementation of this normalisation factor. Since it has to be applied for each weight separately, the correct formula is the one in Equation (\ref{eq::LikelihoodNorm}). 
\begin{equation}\label{eq::LikelihoodNorm}
 -\ln(\mathcal{L}_{Norm}) = - ln(\sum P(y \vert a)*\frac{1}{XS}) = -ln(\mathcal{L}) + N*ln(XS)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth]{/home/annik/Documents/Vub/PhD/ThesisSubjects/AnomalousCouplings/UnderstandLikelihoodDistr_July2014/AnomCouplings_GenEvent_NoSelect_Oct3200Events_SingleGaussUsed/Likelihood_XSNorm.png}
 \caption{Distribution of the $\ln(\mathcal{L})$ after taking into account the XS normalisation. Again 3200 positive semi-muonic have been used and a single gaussian transfer function has been applied. \textbf{WRONG NORMALISATION!}}
 \label{fig::LikelihoodNorm}
\end{figure}

After applying this normalisation, the minimization of $-\ln(\mathcal{L})$ returns the correct value for the $V_R$ component but not for the $V_L$ component. A possible explanation for the wrong results for the left-handed vector coupling is the fact that this parameter only influences the cross section and not the kinematics of the particles present in the decay. Hence it is possible that MadWeight is not optimized for measuring these kind of variables since it focusses on kinematic information. Variables which are directly influenced can be measured by a counting experiment, as is done for the $V_L$ coupling in single-top events. Some additional investigation in this subject is performed and will be discussed further.

\subsection{Control check: Top Mass Measurement}
In order to check whether this XS normalisation results in an overall influence on the obtained MadWeight output, the MadWeight generator had been used to select the most plausible top-quark mass. So instead of generator different ($V_L, V_R$) grid points, five different top-quark masses have been simulated. If this would also return a completely wrong, it would be an important indication of an important issue with MadWeight. This because MadWeight has already been used succesfully to measure the top-quark mass.\\

In order to compare the top-quark mass result with the ($V_L,V_R$) one, a couple of additional comparisons have been performed as will be discussed in detail next. This mainly corresponds to comparing the predefined Standard Model FeynRules model with the newly created Anomalous Couplings one.

\paragraph{Comparing Feynman diagramsSM model with AnomalousCouplings model\\}
As a first step the Feynmann diagrams belonging to the two different models should be compared. This information can be found in the \textit{index.html} file in the following directories:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \tiny{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO/madgraph5/SM\_ttbarSemiMuPlus}  \\
 \tiny{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO/madgraph5/ttbarSemiMuPlus\_QED2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\paragraph{Comparing SM cross section with MassiveLeptons cross section\\}
In order to be sure that both models have the same Standard Model base, the cross sections for both models have been compared. This resulted in an unexpected outcome, namely that the obtained cross sections differ significantly depending on which MadGraph version is used to generate the considered events. A summary can be found in Table \ref{table::MGXS}.
\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{$m_{t}$}	&  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{MadGraph aMC@NLO}	& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{MadGraph v155}  	\\

    163				& $11.12$ pb	& $11.63$ pb			& $7.844$ pb	& $8.199$ pb		\\
    173				& $12.98$ pb	& $13.54$ pb			& $8.897$ pb	& $9.281$ pb		\\

  \hline 
 \end{tabular} 
 \caption{Cross section values for semi-muonic (+) ttbar decay obtained using two different MadGraph versions.} \label{table::MGXS}
\end{table}

From this table can be seen that there is, for both considered MadGraph versions, a small difference between the SM FeynRules model and the MassiveLeptons one. This could be caused by the different treatment of the leptons. In the SM model they are considered to be massless while in the MassiveLeptons one they are defined to have their actual mass.\\
A larger differrence occurs when both MadGraph versions are compared. From the answer received by Olivier it is not clear whether this difference is worrysome or could be explained by the LO theoretical uncertainties. Should also be investigated whether this difference is related to the NLO behavior of the newest MadGraph version. In case the MadGraph v155 version is not up to NLO a difference in cross section is definitely expected.

\paragraph{Understanding why Top Mass simulation does result in correct Likelihood minimum\\}
When using the $MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO$ MadWeight version is used to scan over the different top mass values the correct minimum is obtained directly, so without any normalisation or acceptance influences. This simulation only uses the Standard Model information and doesn't consider the AnomalousCouplings FeynRules model.\\

\subsection{Influence of the acceptance term}
As could be seen from the general Matrix Element formula, Equation (\ref{eq::ProbMW}), also the acceptance $Acc(a)$ has to be taken into account. This term represents the influence of the event selection, which can be different for each point in the considered grid.
Since no reconstructed events exist for the different vector coupling coefficients, the influence of the event selection is currently only be measured on generator-level\footnote{A Fast/FullSim comparison should be done afterwards for a full detailed influence!}. This can introduce a slight bias since applying the reco-level cuts on generator-level result in slightly tighter cuts due to the smaller width of the kinematic distributions. But it is a good way to get an idea of the influence of the event selection and, as long as a flat dependency is found throughout the vector couplings, an acceptable one.\\
\\
The event selection influence is investigated by looking at the variation in cross section and influence on the kinematic distributions. The variation in cross section is measured using 1-dimensional scans of both the left-handed as right-handed vector coupling coefficients while the other is set to its Standard Model expectation value. The results are given in Table \ref{table::XSChangeAccVL} and Table \ref{table::XSChangeAccVR} for the 1D change of $V_L$ and $V_R$, respectively. All the created MadGraph files are located in the following directory:

From these Tables can be concluded that the influence of the event selection on the cross section is flat and equal throughout the entire vector coupling grid. This would be a positive result since it would imply that no additional analytical function is necessary to normalise the MadWeight output. Hence the MadWeight output should only be normalized for the Cross Section influence, but not for the event selection one.\\
\\
The influence of the event selection on the kinematic distributions is measured by comparing the distributions before and after the event selection is applied. Also here, no significant change is observed implying again that the influence of the event selection can be assumed to be flat throughout the entire grid. All the distributions can be found in the local directory $KinematicDistributions\_AcceptanceTerm\_Dec2014$, but the ones for the $\cos \theta^{*}$ variable, the $p_T$ distribution for the lepton, for the b-quark originating from the hadronically decaying top quark and for the down-quark originating from the W-boson decay are given in Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeCosTheta}, Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeLeptonPt}, Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeBJetPt} and Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeDownQPt}, respectively.\\

From the distributions given here can easily be concluded that some shape differences are visible for the 1D-variation of the right-handed vector coupling. However for the left-handed one no influence is visible when varying the value of $V_R$, besides some negligible statistical fluctuations. It is also clear that the influence of the $V_R$ 1D-variation is not the same for each of the kinematical distributions, and even negligible for the $p_T$ distribution of the b-jet originating from the hadronically decaying top quark. Since the shift of the distribution is different for the $p_T$ distribution of the lepton and the down-type quark of the W-boson, the result is still in agreement with the flat change in cross section. This because the additional events for one distribution are balanced out by the reduced number of events for another distribution resulting a net effect of zero and hence a flat behavior troughout the entire vector coupling coefficients grid.

\subsubsection{Understanding 1D-variation of $V_L$}
The influence of the variation of the right-handed vector coupling $V_R$ on the kinematic distributions was rather satisfactory and in some way agreeing with expactations. However the same is definetely not true for the variation of the left-handed vector coupling $V_L$. On the contrary, it can even be stated that the obtained result was a complete surprise and needs to be understood as soon as possible in order to keep confidence in the created FeynRules model. This because a possible explanation can still be a wrong configuration of the anomalousCouplings FeynRules model.

Therefore new MadGraph files, and kinematic distributions, have been created with the same 1D-variation of the left-handed vector coupling $V_L$ but in stead of setting the $V_R$ value equal to its Standard Model expectation of $0$ it was set to $0.2$. The reason behind this different value for $V_R$ is the idea that when the right-handed vector coupling is excluded from the full $Wtb$ Lagrangian any change of $V_L$ only affects the $\vert V_{tb} \vert$ value and hence the cross section. This would imply that no real change of physical concepts is done since the Lagrangian is in a sense unchanged because no mixing of the different vector couplings appears.
The results for this 1D-variation can be found in Table \ref{table::XSChangeAccVLNot0} and in Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeNot0}, and show identical results as for the 1D-variation of $V_L$ with $V_R$ fixed to $0$.

The obtained results for the 1D-variation of $V_L$ with $V_R$ $=$ $0.2$ seem to suggest that either the $V_L$ component only influences the cross section and alters in no way the kinematic distributions or otherwise that this component is wrongly implemented in the created FeynRules model. 
As a final test, a larger 1D-variation of $V_L$ is performed with the $V_R$ component still equal to $0.2$. This resulted in a slightly unexpected outcome, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig::KinChangeNot0LARGE}, since some deviation of the kinematic distribution is found for the configuration where $V_L$ is equal to $0$. However there is no difference between the four other configurations, which is unfortunate because there was some hope that the lack of influence on the kinematic distributions for the $V_L$ component could be caused by the small variation applied.

%\paragraph{\underline{Remark:} Correct way of thinking?\\}
%Isn't it just the opposite normalisation which should be corrected? The left-handed vector coupling only influences the cross section so the log(likelihood) should actually be normalized in such a way that it results in a flat distribution for the 1D-variation of $V_L$. This is which is currently still not correct because of the large difference in relative cross section for values with $V_L$ smaller than $1.0$. While I think that the 1D-variation will, just as was the case for the top quark mass, result in the correct minimization of the log(likelihood) distribution. This because both the influence of this 1D-variation on the kinematic distribution and the variation of the cross section is symmetric around the Standard Model expectation value of $0$.\\
%\\
%Possible suggestion could be to check the influence of another coupling constant, for instance the imaginary part of the left-handed vector coupling. The distinct difference between the left-handed vector coupling and all the other coupling parameters implemented in the FeynRules model is its Standard Model value. The left-handed vector coupling is the only parameter which is supposed to contribute to the $Wtb$ Lagrangian, and hence the only one different from $0$. Therefore it could be a possible test of the created FeynRules model to check both the variation of the cross section as the influence on the kinematic distributions when a different coupling constant is considered. If it would only be that the real part of the $V_R$ doesn't contribute to the kinematics of the decay particles while all the other ones do have a distinct effect, it could be a clear indication that the created FeynRules model is not capable of dealing with coupling constants higher than $1$.

%\paragraph{Thinking $\cdots$ \\} 
%However this last conclusion is not completely correct because then a possible effect would have been visible when the $V_L$ variable was varied in a larger range. In this case also the configurations $V_L$ = 0.5 and $V_L$ = 0.0 was compared to the Standard Model expectation of $1.0$ but no effect was found. So there is more behind the non-influence of the left-handed vector coupling $V_L$ than just a problem with dealing with coupling coefficients larger than $1.0$ $\cdots$.

%Need to check how it is possible that the XS values in the XS grid are identical for both versions (first check whether this is indeed the case), but are different for the top quark mass simulation ... Table \ref{table::MGXS}.
