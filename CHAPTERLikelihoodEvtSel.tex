\section{Issue: Change of VR not found in likelihood shape}

\underline{First test configuration:} \\
MadGraph sample created with $Re(V_{R})$ = + 0.08 \\
$\Rightarrow$ Should result in a minimum around +0.08 when looking at summed likelihood!
\\
\\
\textbf{\underline{But obtained result is not as expected ...}}\\
Distributions given below are the total -ln(likelihood) when no cuts are applied, when only $\chi^{2}$-cut is applied and when the $\chi^{2}$-cut is combined with requiring the slope of the polynomial fit to be positive.\\
\\
For each of the cases this result is obtained by first fitting all the 21 points with a 2nd degree polynomial, removing the 7 points which are the farthest away from this fit distribution and then fitting again the remaining 14 points with another 2nd degree polynomial.\\
The overal -ln(likelihood) distribution is obtained by summing all the separate -ln(L) fit distributions.\\
\\
The cuts which are applied always use the $\chi^{2}$ or the slope of this second fit.\\
\\
\underline{Remark: Low statistics ..}\\
For the moment the statistics is still rather low, because my MadWeight calculation for the full 10000 events crashed yesterday.\\
They are currently still running and should be finished later today.

So in order to make sure whether this unexpected position of the minimum was caused by the created ROOT macros I decided to repeat this test also for the top mass. If the position of the minimum would correspond with the top mass used for creating the MadGraph sample, the VR-issue above is not caused by the used ROOT macros ...\\
\\
As expected for the top mass all results look as expected. However since the top mass can be measured much more precisely the influence of the cuts on the -ln(likelihood) are less significant. The -ln(L) distribution without any cut applied already results in the correct position of the minimum ..\\
\\
Here only 5 points have been used (mainly for speeding up MadWeight CPU time) so only 1 point is removed before the second fit is applied.\\
\\
The first three distributions correspond to the MadGraph sample created with $m_{top}$ = 172 GeV while the second one was created with $m_{top}$ = 174 GeV.\\
\\
\textbf{\underline{Search for VR-issue}}\\
Now that the control check using the top mass MadGraph samples indicated that the created ROOT macros and the consecutive fitting procedure does work as should be, I will continue to investigate why this is not the case for the anomalous couplings.\\
Maybe the use of more statistics can help but I found it rather strange that with reduced statistics the position of the minimum is nicely positioned around $0$. Maybe the change of VR-component was not translated into the produced MadGraph sample, this I will check by creating some MadAnalysis plots which easily compares the kinematic information of different MadGraph samples.
